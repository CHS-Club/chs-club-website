Our club's mission is to foster interest in the field of computational health sciences by:

-   Hosting speakers to share their experiences working/researching in the field,
-   Assisting students identify and obtain research and internship opportunities, and
-   Leading hands-on extracurricular projects for members to get involved with.

If any of that sounds interesting to you, please peruse our [handbook](./handbook/) and [join us in person](./schedule)!
