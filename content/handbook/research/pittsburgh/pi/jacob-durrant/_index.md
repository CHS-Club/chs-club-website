## Research focus

Durrant's research is primarily concentrated in two key areas: computer-aided drug design (CADD) and computational structural biology.
Overall, Durrant's research aims to advance the field of computational biology and accelerate the drug discovery process by developing and applying novel computational methods and tools.
Specifically:

1.  **Small-molecule ligand identification:** Durrant's lab is at the forefront of developing and applying advanced computational techniques. These techniques are used to design small-molecule ligands that can bind to protein targets and potentially disrupt their functions. This work is particularly focused on accelerating drug discovery for infectious diseases, neurological conditions, and cancer.
2.  **Improving CADD methods:** The lab works on enhancing existing CADD techniques, particularly in molecular docking, scoring functions, and the use of machine learning and big data approaches to improve the accuracy of binding predictions.
3.  **Molecular dynamics simulations:** Durrant's team uses molecular dynamics to study protein motions and how they affect ligand binding, including large-scale simulations of subcellular environments.
4.  **Development of computational tools:** Durrant has created several open-source software tools, such as AutoGrow, POVME, and LigMerge, to assist in drug discovery and molecular analysis.
